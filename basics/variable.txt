In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:

    int - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
    double - stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
    char - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Char values are surrounded by single quotes
    string - stores text, such as "Hello World". String values are surrounded by double quotes
    bool - stores values with two states: true or false

When you do not want others (or yourself) to change existing variable values, use the 
const keyword (this will declare the variable as "constant", which means unchangeable and read-only):

Data Type	Size	        Description
boolean	   1 byte	        Stores true or false values
char	   1 byte	        Stores a single character/letter/number, or ASCII values
int	       2 or 4 bytes	    Stores whole numbers, without decimals
float	   4 bytes	        Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 6-7 decimal digits
double	   8 bytes	        Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits
